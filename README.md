# ActiveRecord::Encryption

This is an extraction of the Rails 7 ActiveRecord::Encryption framework, minus
a few things:

* ActionText support -- we don't use it, so we've omitted it entirely.

* That's actually it for the moment.

## License

The license for this is the same as the license for Rails itself, since this
is merely an extraction for use with Rails 6. See `MIT-LICENSE` for details.
